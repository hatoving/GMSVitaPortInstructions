# GameMaker Studio PS Vita Port Instructions

Hi! You must be here to play the games I ported on your Vita.
Follow this guide then.

NOTE: If you want to request a game, please either make a issue and add the "request" label on it or contect me on Twitter.

Credits to m1s3ry and Grossleymoo for making this possible!

WARNING!!!
These instructions will be obsolete, kind of. From now on, I will make batch files that patch the files themselves rather than yourself, similar to how m1s3ry does it.

## Step One: Getting the files
In order for the game you want to play to work properly, you'll need the game files.

### Android ports
Go ahead, pay and download the game you want to play on your Vita (example: Fran Bow).

#### Game without `OBB`
If the game doesn't have a `.obb` file to make the game work on Android, then you can proceed.

Go to `Your Phone Storage/Android/com.gamename.company/assets` and copy-paste all files in it in a in a safe folder where you can come back to (I'll reference it as a Patch Folder).

##### Note, the `com.gamename.company` is the "App ID" of your game. You can find that in the app's Play Store URL after 'id'.

#### Game with `OBB`
If the game does have a `.obb` file, you won't find anything in the assets folder.
Instead, all assets will be located in the `.obb` file. 
Find said `.obb` file in `Your Phone Storage/Android/obb/com.gamename.company` and extract it. Then, go its assets folder.
Copy-Paste all files from the `.obb` file and put them in a Patch Folder.

### PC ports
Nothing fancy, go to game's directory and copy and paste all of the game's assets.

##### Note, some games I port may have a marking on them, example: GAMENAME_Device. This is important because Game Maker names the `data.win` file differently specific to other devices. Another example: Windows: `data.win`, Mac OS: `game.ios`, Linux: `game.unx`, Android: `game.droid` and so on.

## Step Two: Patching the files
Now it's time to patch the files. 

### Older patches
First, get the `data.win`/`game.droid` file and rename it to `game.win`. 
Then, go back here to the repo and go to the Releases page. Pick the game you want to play on your Vita and save the `.zip` file (not the source code) to your Patch Folder.

Extract the `.zip` file and delete the `.zip` file afterwards.
Now, go to the DeltaPatcher folder and execute `DeltaPatcher.exe`.

##### Note, DeltaPatcher is a patching tool for `.xdelta` files. The program is for Windows only sadly, so if you're using Mac or Linux, try to launch it with Wine.

After you opened the `.exe` file, you will see a GUI. Select the "Original file" as the `game.win` file you renamed and the "XDelta patch" as the `.xdelta` from the `.zip` file you extracted. Wait a few seconds and presto! The `game.win` file has been patched for your PS Vita.

### Newer patches
Unzip the `.zip` you downloaded from the Releases page in the Patch Folder.
Copy the game assets including the `game.win` file in the `PatchedFiles/games` folder.

Execute the batch file from the `.zip`and let it do its job.

## Step Three: Installing the game and replacing the files
It's time! Now it's only a matter of time to actually play the game.

First, install the VPK included in the Releases page or in the `.zip` file you downloaded for the game trough VitaShell.
Go to the game's directory page on your Vita in `ux0:app/GAMEID`.

##### Note, you can find the port's game ID by looking at the `INFO.txt` file from .zip file you extracted.

### Older patches
Now, grab the patched `game.win` and its contents from the Patch folder and put it in `ux0:app/GAMEID/games` through FTP or USB.
### Newer patches
Just copy everything from the folder in the .zip file (`.zip file/PatchedFiles/ganes`) and paste it into `ux0:app/GAMEID/games`.

## Step Four: There is no Step Four.
Congrats! Now, you can launch the game and play it! Have fun!
